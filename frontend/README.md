## ✅ What's Been Fixed

1. **Project Structure**: Created proper directory structure following guidelines
2. **Missing Components**: Created all missing components that App.js was trying to import:
   - `AuthContext` - Authentication state management
   - `Login` - Professional login form
   - `ProtectedRoute` - Route protection
   - `Dashboard` - Main dashboard with statistics
   - `Layout` - Navigation and app structure
   - Placeholder components for Tickets, Users, Equipment

3. **Authentication Flow**: Complete authentication system with:
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Token management
   - Route protection
   - Error handling

4. **UI/UX**: Professional Material-UI implementation with:
   - Responsive design
   - Government-appropriate styling
   - Proper navigation drawer
   - Loading states

5. **API Integration**: Services properly configured for backend communication

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash

   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - You'll be redirected to the login page
